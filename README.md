# Tools
A set of great tools for development

This project use a Helper file from the Akelos Framework
FileName is Inflector
Inflector for pluralize and singularize English nouns.
This Inflector is a port of Ruby on Rails Inflector. It can be really helpful for developers that want to create 
frameworks based on naming conventions rather than configurations.
It was ported to PHP for the Akelos Framework, a multilingual Ruby on Rails like framework for PHP that will be launched
soon.
